‚úîÔ∏è Update ref buff

‚úîÔ∏è Other functions remain the same

===========================
üñ• Instructions (nodejs required):

1Ô∏è‚É£ npm install to update the module. Reconfigure the .env file according to your needs.

2Ô∏è‚É£ If you only want to use the ref buff function , run node autoRef . (The following steps are only for quests)

3Ô∏è‚É£ privateKeys.txt stores EVM wallet private key. tokens.txt stores apiKey , you can get it manually on the web (application => storage => apiKey ) or the tool will automatically get it through privateKey

proxy.txt save proxy proxy format: http://user:pass@ip:port

4Ô∏è‚É£ Run node setup to get the wallet address via the private key. The wallet address will be saved in the wallets.txt file.

5Ô∏è‚É£ Run the tool with the command: node main or node main-proxy

===========================
‚ö†Ô∏è Buff ref ae can use proxy, share, scan anything. Do not use proxy or you will get error 429.

‚ö†Ô∏è If the ref buff doesn't work, go to the .env file to see the configuration. I support you guys on-site so I eat 10% of the ref you can buff (1000 refs, I eat 100)üëå )
